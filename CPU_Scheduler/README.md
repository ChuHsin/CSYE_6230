# Design and Implement CPU Scheduler for Priority Based Scheduling

Design an implement a CPU scheduler which is priority based. Here is what it should do:

1. Ten Threads will be creating jobs of random length between 5 and 10 seconds.

2. Priority of the jobs will be between 1 and 5. (1 is highest priority and 5 is lowest priority)

3. These jobs will be saved in a priority queue

4. Create a Priority based thread which will remove the highest priority job and finish the job. 

All these threads will be running in a while(true) loop. 

Use any programming language to implement this. 

Pay special attention to synchronization of shared data
